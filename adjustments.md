#Further adjustments can be played to modify an existing game

## Played with Confidence: 
* If at any point someone folds, all remaining players must re-ante to continue play. If someone folds during the confidence ante it repeats a re-ante with all remaining players.
## Played with No Peak: 
* Any hands dealt face down to a player cannot be looked at. Dealer chooses penalty for peaking - e.g. matching the pot, large ante per card, etc.
## Played with Low Hand: 
* An adjustment to poker scoring making the worst possible poker hand the winning hand. Dealer decides how ties are handled. Dealer decides best hand as Wheel (Ace-5 straight), Aces Low (Aces-to-Six), or Duece-to-seven.
## Played with Addition: 
* Modification to 7card allowing the player to add any non-face ranks together to create a non-suited non-face rank. 
* Players still need 5 cards to play a poker hand. 
* Aces used in Addition are '1'. 
* Adding 5D + 6C sums over 10 and is invalid. Adding a 3S + 7C creates an unsuited 10. Adding a AD + AH creates an unsuited 2. Unsuited cards should be considered a 5th no-suit suit.
